							<p class="bigger-text"><u>Our SDG Introduction and Stakeholders</u>
							<br>	In our journey towards promoting sustainability, we began by introducing ourselves to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. We evaluated our project ideas against two key SDGs #12: Responsible consumption and production and #15: Life on land. To ensure our efforts were aligned with global sustainability initiatives, we engaged with iGEM teams from around the world. Notable collaborations included iGEM Bulgaria, iGEM CCU Taiwan, and others, where we met virtually to synchronize our goals.</br>			
							During this phase, we also had the privilege of interacting with prominent SDG stakeholders like Mr. Andrew Nicholls and Mr. Joe Chen through online meetings. These individuals shared invaluable insights, guiding our project and enhancing our knowledge related to the SDGs. Their expertise significantly influenced the direction and impact of our initiatives.

							<p class="bigger-text"><u>Collaborations with Other Teams on the SDGs and Integration of Ideas</u>
								<br>Building upon our initial engagement with iGEM teams, we fostered partnerships with iGEM Ais-Marseille and iGEM Universitas Indonesia. Together, and with translation help from a range of teams and outside collaborators, we initiated the "Picture Book" translation project, aimed at making the SDGs, as well as their connections to iGEM and synthetic biology, accessible on a global scale and across language barriers. </br>			
								Through our postcard initiative, we showcased SDG-related projects of iGEM, emphasizing the power of global collaboration in achieving sustainability. 
								<br>In a bid to educate and inspire the younger generation of our school, we organized an SDG workshop for students in grades 7 to 9. This workshop served as a platform to introduce all 17 SDGs, connect them to our project, and encourage active engagement. Moreover, we promoted awareness of the SDGs through a dedicated library display at Kang Chiao International School, providing a tangible and interactive way for the community to learn and connect with these global goals. </br>			
								Throughout our journey, we remainexd staunch advocates for the SDGs, emphasizing our unwavering commitment to working collaboratively with iGEM teams to advance these vital global objectives.
								<br>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations, aiming to transform our world into more sustainable practices[1]. With the increasing awareness of human impact on the environment, the SDGs have been more widely valued, both nationally and internationally. Through our research, we examined the issue of animal leather and its negative impacts. Therefore, our team hopes to contribute to the global community through our project to use the fermented-beverage-product Kombucha’s cellulose byproduct known as SCOBY as a leather replacement, focusing on goal 12. Responsible consumption and production, and 15. Life on land[1]. </br>

								SDGs aim for responsible consumption and production focusing on reducing the carbon footprint of customer products by modifying approaches to the production and consumption of goods and resources[1]. According to research, the carbon footprint of cow skin leather is found to be 110.0kg of CO2e per square meter and the carbon footprint of leather is approximately 15.8kg of CO2e emissions per square meter. It has been shown that a single fermentation of SCOBY requires a 97 percent lower carbon footprint than synthetic polyurethane leather [2,3,4]. By replacing animal or polyurethane leather with SCOBY leather, carbon emissions will be reduced significantly.
								<br>In the contemporary leather industry, many harmful chemicals are used in its manufacturing, such as acids, salts, and enzymes all cause a series of impacts on the aquatic environment. This leads the leather manufacturing industry to generate around 38% of the wastewater worldwide, which has a high concentration of salts and is poorly biodegradable. Moreover, according to an analysis by Hansen et al, an examination of forty-three leather tanning formulations shows that, on average, 360.2 kg of chemicals and 8.6 cubic meters of water are used to produce one ton of shaved leather.[5]. If leather industries transitioned to SCOBY leather instead of animal leather, far fewer chemicals would be needed to achieve the production of quality leather, reaching target goal 12.4: “reduce [chemicals] release to air, water, and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment[6].” Since leather workers are exposed to the chemicals during the process of chromium-tanning. 246 hazardous chemicals are used in 95% of animal tanning in the leather industry, which causes 27.1% of exposed workers to have respiratory issues like bronchitis, asthma, and lung cancer.</br>
								The SCOBY leather combats SDG subgoal 12. 5: “[reducing] waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse[6].” Once a leather product has been discarded, the issue of biodegradability arises. Since the production of SCOBY is natural and degradable, SCOBY, the byproduct of the popular drink kombucha, makes it possible to reuse the kombucha manufacturing process to reduce waste as a positive circular economy model and decrease waste[16].

								15. Life on land

								According to the UN, SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, specifically on biodiversity loss[8]. Our project corresponds to the 15.5 goal, “Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species”. Leather finds frequent use in the fashion industry accessories: according to reports from the World Wildlife Fund, from 1998 to 2014, more than 2 billion farm animals were killed globally each year, and around 83% of all these animals’ hides and skin became leather. 
								<br>By replacing animal leather with biodegradable SCOBY-made leather that is more eco-friendly and flexible, we can lessen the deaths of animals and protect biodiversity. As much as 8% of greenhouse gasses and 20% of global wastewater are attributed to the fashion industry, we hope to use our SCOBY product to mitigate the potential impact that the supply of wildlife leather products creates[11].</br>
								Some trends also show the public's consumption of alternative protein sources instead of raising more cattle for meat. To illustrate this, a study from New York Times Magazine indicates that people around the world have been eating less beef in recent years. In the magazine, the Natural Resources Defense Council pointed out that beef consumption among Americans declined by 19%, nearly one-fifth, from 2005 to 2014. This trend is reinforced by a 2022 survey by the International Food Information Council, in which 65 percent of Americans reported eating plant-based meat alternatives in 2022, showing many are actually deciding to switch to alternative protein sources. Researchers predict that by 2035 more than 35% of all animal protein will be produced through an industrial cell-based fermentation process, and total animal-farmed protein dropping to less than 40% of total protein consumed [15]. Therefore, fewer animals will be farmed and available. So, in our project, using SCOBY to transition from these destructive practices is in line with the trend away from farmed meat consumption and toward a more sustainable, responsible, and cruelty-free human society. SCOBY-leather can help supply the need for leather while reducing the demand for food and land spaces from the cattle industry, which will also contribute to alleviating the pollution released in the environment.

								<br>Through connecting with stakeholders from the professional field and receiving their opinions regarding our project with the SDGs goals is important. Therefore, our team reached out to two professions: Mr. Andrew Nicholls who works in a non-governmental organization associated with SDGs and Mr. Joe Chen who has a professional license on SDGs. After meeting with them, we gained more accurate information regarding SDGs goals and edited our project information that can later be used to spread to the public.</br>

							</h4>
						  
							  
						  	<p class="bigger-text">
						  		We invited Mr. Andrew Nicholls to our school and shared his 20 years of SCOBY experience with our team during summer vacation. 
						 		Since Mr. Nicholls has experience discussing SDGs with a non-governmental organization related to SDGs, we invited him to evaluate our project’s correlation with SDG goals. Firstly, he informed us that it is unfeasible and impossible to completely eliminate animal-leather production as the public is still using it. But SCOBY is an alternative solution to mitigate the impact. Yet, we need  to acknowledge sugar, the main ingredient in SCOBY production, can also originate from unsustainable sugarcane farming practices. Our team aims to “reduce” animal-leather instead of “eliminating”. Therefore, our team will emphasize the comparison of carbon footprint on sugarcane farming and cow growing: SCOBY only produces 0.42kg per m2 of CO2 (the use of sugar) but animal leather produces 17 kg per m2 CO2. 
						  		Furthermore, Mr. Nicholls verified our connection of SDGs with goal 12 and 15 as we considered these two as the most crucial ones. Since animal-leather has a direct relationship to animals on land because the use of SCOBY-leather creates an environmental-friendly solution towards the environment. This also facilitates goal 15 because with a more sustainable alternative while raising awareness to the public, people will shift their buying habits, potentially saving more animal lives and reducing environmental waste.

							<p class="bigger-text">
								After completing our project concept, we contacted Mr. Joe Chen who is the Deloitte & Touche Sustainability Service Leader, ISO 14064-1 Lead Verifier, ISO 14064-2 Lead Verifier, so we presented our project to him to receive professional feedback. Originally, we connected our project with the two SDGs goals. However Mr. Chen informed us that we needed to specify the sub goals for each that corresponds with our project. Therefore, after thorough research, 12.4, 12.5, and 15.5 are all the subgoals we found that we believe our project is best able to connect with, and we also further elaborated in each section. Moreover, Mr. Chen informed us our project is somewhat connected to goal 16: Peace, justice, and strong institutions. Because some companies kill animals for leather illegally, and by using SCOBY, institutions can also step in to terminate and prevent these incidents. Mr. Chen also provided us with several websites regarding the circular economy, including Ellen MacArthor organization[16]. Through further investigation, the team believed our product falls under the category of remanufacture, to minimize wastes and fulfill subgoals of SDGs 12.Highlighting the connection between raw materials used to create SCOBY and agriculture, Mr. Chen suggested our group examine how the SCOBY industry can decrease greenhouse gas emissions and foster employment, cultural products, and tourism. This sustains our future plan. If we plan to start an entrepreneur, then we will further investigate according to these changes, but right now we will research the carbon footprint to compare. Lastly, Mr. Chen suggested we promote our SDGs to a broader community and diverse audiences; thus, be creative and innovative. Our team therefore launched a series of activities such as workshops, SDGs competitions, picture books, educational videos, and collaboration with other teams. Through these efforts, and connecting our project to our society, we hope to intrigue the public's awareness on animal-leather.

								The impact on how we use and communicate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was made clear through a series of meetings with invited teams, including iGEM Bulgaria, iGEM CCU Taiwan, iGEM VIT, iGEM Ais-Marseille, iGEM Korea HS, iGEM ASIJ, East Coast Biocrew, QGEM, iGEMS Taiwan, iGEM Kyoto, and iGEM Bochum. 
								Teams presented their initiatives and discussed how they linked to certain SDGs during these sessions, providing a better understanding of the various ways that projects contribute to global sustainability. Innovative solutions to tackling  global concerns were produced as a result of the cross-pollination of ideas. As teams thought about shared or complementary SDG-related goals, collaborative goal formulation arose, increasing the potential for collective influence. In conclusion, these gatherings acted as a catalyst for initiatives to be aligned with the SDGs, for cooperation, and for developing a common commitment to making a significant difference on a global scale in the quest for sustainable development. 
								Following the conference calls, iGEM Aix-Marseille, iGEM Korea HS, iGEM Bochum, iGEM Ionis, NIS-Kazakhstan, and Edinburgh iGEM all consented to assist us in translating our Picture Book into their respective native tongues allowing it to reach a broader audience (the following pages will have further discussion regarding the Picture Book).

The event's main purpose is to showcase the ecology that makes flowers and our planet so remarkable, SDG 15 (Life on land). They stated that we can do so by reducing the amount of water required during heat waves, implementing the circular economy model, and using bacteria instead of seaweeds, but also by limiting CO2 emissions and the negative effects of drought, such as unusable soils and wildfires, which lead to crop/biodiversity loss, famine, and diseases. As a result, our sharing may help children comprehend how vital and lovely biodiversity is.

								<br>We invited different teams to work with us in translating our "Picture Book" into their native languages. This book explains the objectives of our project, the value of environmental preservation, our commitment to the SDGs, and how our project reaches the SDGs goals. By demonstrating how we address various challenges through the accomplishment of these goals in various scenarios with the help of them, we hope to make the SDGs more understandable to a wider global audience without language barriers. We also hope to promote this Picture Book around their educational institutions or nearby hospitals. Our attempts to collaborate closely with other iGEM teams in furthering the SDGs will start with this partnership.

								We scheduled to host an SDGs workshop for students to introduce them to the SDGs and how they relate to our project. During this session, we familiarized KCIS students with all 17 SDGs, teaching them to recognize each one and understand their real-world applications. Additionally, we presented our project, discussing the problem we aim to address, and our proposed solution, and offering a simplified overview of our experiment procedure. To reinforce the learning, we concluded the session with an interactive Kahoot game to review the material. Through this event, we not only enhanced students' comprehension of SDGs and our project but also encouraged them to identify SDGs in various contexts and contemplate ways they can actively contribute to the achievement of these global goals. This workshop signifies our commitment to collaborating with other iGEM teams in advancing the SDGs' cause. 
								Ms. Vicky Hsueh, the main supporter of our event from the library, believes that our workshop is amazing as it connects really well with the library’s book display and educates the students in an engaging way. According to the feedback form that we asked the participants to fill out, most of them believe this event is helpful for their learning and all of them have ideas on how they can contribute to the achievement of SDGs. 
								In the poll, we discovered that 100 percent of respondents believed that our iGEM project and synthetic biology both contributed to and accomplished the SDGs, and 87.5 percent of respondents thought our presentation helped them understand more about the SDGs. The two SDGs that participants want to contribute to the most are SDG 2: zero hunger and SDG 1: no poverty, and they explain how they plan to do this by advocating for socialism, which would reduce poverty rates, enhance the basic welfare of all citizens, and work with other organizations to donate or provide food to those in need.

								In this 2023 KCIS Xiugang Taipei iGEM X Library collaboration, we actively promoted the Sustainable Development Goals. Our primary objective was to promote SDGs, which is what the library wants to do as well. However, while the library is trying to encourage students to read SDGs-related books, we will bring in more of the applications of SDGs on synthetic biology. This ensures that more people comprehend the importance of SDGs and how they align with our mission to address critical issues. This event also underscores our dedication to collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to collectively advance the cause of the SDGs. In addition, to promote this collaboration, we put flyers in many teachers’ classrooms, hoping more students will notice this learning opportunity.

								In the “I Can SDGs” Contest held from 2023/9/18 to 2023/9/26, we actively promoted the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals by providing templates for students to write down why they believe SDGs is important and how they con contribute to it. Once they are done, they get to put their response in the cute box so that they can attend this contest. Top responders are rewarded with mystery gifts. Our primary objective was to help students learn about other SDGs and be responsible citizens by thinking about their own approaches to help achieve SDGs. This ensures that more people comprehend the importance of SDGs and how they align with our mission to address critical issues. This event also underscores our dedication to collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to collectively advance the cause of the SDGs.

								In the Quiz Activity held from 2023/9/18 to 2023/9/28, we actively promoted the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Our primary objective was to encourage students to learn from our display and help them remember what they’ve learned for a long period of time, maximizing the effect of this display, by applying the testing effect, which is to create a small quiz for them to do. All the necessary information that is required to answer the questions can be found on the display. This ensures that more people comprehend the importance of SDGs and how they align with our mission to address critical issues. This event also underscores our dedication to collaborating with fellow iGEM teams to collectively advance the cause of the SDGs. 
								Ms. Vicky Hsueh, one of our attributes, mentioned that it would be nice to have a quiz to test the student’s understanding, which inspired us to create this activity. However, there are not a lot of participants in this activity. To improve this in the future, we can promote this activity better and further encourage students to participate.
