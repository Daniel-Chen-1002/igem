Fig 6: During ligation of MaSp2, the team used one XmaI single enzyme cut site for the cloning that would give our team two orientations of MaSp2 cloned between the pGal1,10 promoter and CBD.

We used forward primer on the 5’- end of MaSp2, and reverse primer on the 3’- end of CBD to do PCR.

	Overall,the purpose of making these composite parts is that the CBM1 in yeast (discussed as CBD) protein cloned to the downstream the pGal1,10 promoter, an inducible promoter to manipulate the transcription of CBD in the presence of galactose, and then MaSp1 and MaSp2 were cloned between the pGal1,10 promoter and CBD, respectively, to make MaSp1-CBD and MaSp2-CBD fusion proteins. The purpose of cloning this CBM1 (referred to as CBD) is to carry our spider silk proteins, MaSp1, and MaSp2 to bind to SCOBY membranes to make our team’s scoby membranes more flexible and softer. 
	</p>
	<p class="bigger-text">
	To manipulate our team’s spider silk proteins, MaSp1, MaSp2, and CBD, 3 different composite parts were generated. BBa_K4650004 contained BBa_K4650000+BBa_K4650001 (pGal1,10-CBD); BBa_K4650005 contained BBa_K4650000+BBa_K4650002+BBa_K4650001 (pGal1,10-MaSp1 -CBD); BBa_K4650006 contained BBa_K4650000+BBa_K4650003+ BBa _K 4650001(pGal1,10- MaSp2-CBD). BBa_K4650004, BBa_K4650005, and BBa_ K4650006 were then transformed into wild-type Saccharomyces yeast strain, BY4741, respectively. After finishing these 3 composite parts, our team also sent them out to Mission Biotech to do DNA sequences in order to confirm them as 100% correct DNA sequences.

Pombe encodes for the cellulose binding domain (CBD) protein cloned downstream of the galactose promoter, an inducible promoter to manipulate the transcription of CBD in the presence of galactose. The purpose of manipulating CBD is to be a carrier for our team’s spider silk proteins to scoby membranes in the composite parts, BBa_K4650005, and BBa_K4650006.

The internal control gene, ACT1, was used to detect the ACT1 mRNA level at different time courses as standard. The BY4741 contained different composite parts, respectively, were grown in 2%YP-glucose, until OD600 0.2-0.4, and then 35 ml of yeast culture medium was taken out as 0 min as a control. Without galactose, the pGal promoter would not be switched on to perform the downstream of genes’ inductions. Then transferring the 3 composite parts of the yeast culture samples from 2%YP-glucose to 2%YP-galactose medium, our team took out 30ml of yeast culture medium samples at different time courses in the presence of galactose.

In the presence of galactose, which induced pGal1, 10 promoter’s switch, the downstream genes, CBD, MaSp1-CBD, MaSp2-CBD were transcribed at least 2-fold mRNA inductions of MaSp1-CBD and MaSp2-CBD as our experimental samples, and highly induced at least 20 fold mRNA of CBD as our control sample. However, our team only did one of the RT-qPCR experiments so repeating the RT-qPCR experiment is necessary. However, if only one BY4741 yeast containing one composite part showed mRNA induction, but not the other two, it would still make the data unreliable since only one composite part was induced.

    To enable our team to test the strength of the modified SCOBY, the team created a strength testing machine to hold the SCOBY and test how much force it can hold. The wooden frame would be a hollow square with two sides attached with a vice. The vice is operated by spinning the handle clockwise to clamp the scoby tight and firm. The force gauge will be used to contact the scoby with a 1.54 cm2 circular area. The machine would record the applied force’s first peak value in newtons as the SCOBY breaks, as described in Experiment.

    As shown in figure 10, genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp2-CBD protein gave the highest weighting capacity (258N), and genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp1-CBD protein was the second highest (118.8N). Therefore we can conclude that genetically modified SCOBY that had been co-cultured with MaSp1-CBD, and MaSp2-CBD, respectively, increases its strength and durability.

Fig10: Genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp2-CBD protein showed a significantly higher weighting capacity among all, with a carrying capacity of 258 newtons. Followed by genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp1-CBD protein with 118.8 newtons and genetically modified SCOBY with CBD protein with 105.7 newtons. The SCOBY that was co-cultured with BY4741 only performed the lowest carrying capacity of 52.2 newton.

        Next, in order to assess the flexibility of our SCOBY, our team created a device that consists of a 3D-printed wheel attached to a piece of wood that will be paired with another wood block and a second pair of wood blocks. Once the device was set up, the lower set of wooden blocks allowed the SCOBY membrane to twist as the wheel turned on its path, while the upper set of wooden blocks remained stationary. By measuring the amount of force required for the SCOBY to twist a certain angle, the team can determine how flexible it is. If less force is applied, it means the SCOBY is more flexible, as elaborated on in Experiment. 3 trials were performed.

        Fig 11 summarizes our findings. The negative control has an average force of 1.292 N applied for a 40° rotation. With the same degree rotated, pGal-CBD 0.401 N more force than the negative control, indicating that CBD protein is slightly more rigid. MaSp1-CBD protein needs an average force of 1.004 N, which is 0.288 N less than the negative control. Since it requires 22.29% less force, MaSp1-CBD protein is more flexible than the negative control. MaSp2-CBD protein needs an average force of 0.985 N, which is 0.305N less than for the negative control. In addition, the error bars did not overlap, indicating a significant difference. The 23.76% decrease indicates that the MaSp2-CBD SCOBY is more flexible than the unmodified SCOBY, or negative control.

            Fig 11: The genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp1-CBD protein, and MaSp2-CBD protein, separately, required less strength for 40 degree turn. The SCOBY, co-cultured with BY4741 only, required the most strength of 1.292 newton to make a 40 degree turn, similar to the one with CBD protein only (1.378N), followed by genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp2-CBD protein of 0.985 newton and genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp1-CBD protein of 1 newton.

            While preliminary results indicate the spider silk genes, MaSp1 and MaSp2 have achieved the result of a more flexible SCOBY, during the experiment, we noticed many factors that might affect the results. First, the thickness of the membrane directly affects the amount of force needed to twist the SCOBY: thicker SCOBY needs more force. Although we attempted to control this by growing SCOBY for the same amount of time, the thickness still has obvious variations, which may also be caused by how dry the SCOBY actually is. Second, the speed of twisting directly affects the amount of force measured: higher speed will result in higher force measured. We tried to control this by twisting the SCOBY for the same amount of time, which may help keep the speed constant. But still, it is difficult to control it completely, leading to errors in the data. So we also did many trials to minimize the effect the errors bring. Finally, we realized that twisting the SCOBY many times causes the inelastic membranes to deform, so there will be less restoring force pulling the force sensor, leading to a decreased measured force, which may be misinterpreted as higher flexibility. This factor is difficult to control unless we only do one trial on each SCOBY, which is not an ideal solution as it will require a lot of labor to grow so many of them. Therefore, further investigation and trials still need to be done on this experiment to make sure our data is reliable.

            <strong class="font-weight-extra-bold">Conclusion</strong>
</h2>
<p class="bigger-text">
To test the outcome of genetically modified SCOBY with different spider silks fused with CBD, the team designed two machines to test the strength and flexibility via different forces. The data in fig10 and 11 clearly show that the strength and flexibility of our genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp1-CBD,and MaSp2-CBD fusion proteins, respectively, were both stronger and more flexible compared to the control SCOBY only or SCOBY with CBD. Overall, our team has shown convincing preliminary evidence that genetically modified SCOBY with MaSp1-CBD and MaSp2-CBD protein can hold significantly stronger strength and are more flexible to generate useful products in the future.

    </h2>
    <p class="bigger-text">
    The team noticed some weaknesses in our data. First of all, our team only had time to finish one trial of the RT-qPCR experiment, and even though the data is convincing, showing the downstream genes of the pGal1,10 promoter did induce mRNA transcription in the presence of galactose, repeated  RT-qPCR trials will be necessary to validate our team’s biological functional assay’s data. Second, the SCOBY was dried directly inside the oven, resulting in a wrinkled surface which may cause inaccuracy in measuring data. Therefore the team decided to flatten SCOBY by placing a heavy object above it when drying, aiming to completely flatten SCOBY. Third, since we only include 1 batch of tested samples, to increase the validity of our project, the team aims to conduct more batches of testing regarding the modified SCOBY’s flexibility.
