										<u>What are PET Plastics?</u>

									</p>
								
									<p class="bigger-text">
										The resin identification code system divided plastics into seven categories by their structures and density, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and others (Plastics for Change ). PET, in particular, is one of the most common plastics we see in our daily lives. Accordingly, 390.7 million tons of plastic were produced, while PET constituted 6.2% of plastic production. PET has a wide variety of uses from textile to food packaging to plastic bottles (Guo).

									<p class="bigger-text">
										Unlike HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, and PVC, PET doesn’t have a carbon backbone. PET is a polyester containing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid as its repeating units. PET can be both semi-crystalline and amorphous depending on the conditions during crystallization. A quicker cooling process will result in a transparent amorphous structure. A slower cooling process produces a semi-crystalline structure, with a stronger, translucent product.

								<strong class="font-weight-extra-bold">PET Degradation Pathway</strong>
							</h4>
								<p class = "bigger-text">
									PET degradation pathway is an eco-friendly strategy with no detrimental environmental impacts. In recent decades, scientists have discovered several organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and microalgae can biodegrade PET, and use the degraded products as carbon sources to growth. (not sure if it’s true, research more). Fungi like Aspergillus niger also contribute to PET degradation by secreting enzymes that diffuse through agar and degrade the polymer into water soluble materials. Microalgae have been found to colonize plastic surfaces in aquatic environments, forming biofilms and creating a microenvironment that promotes its degradation. One of the bacterial strains, Ideonella sakaiensis, was discovered and well-studied with its PET hydrolase(PETase) and MHETase enzymes, which are essential for PET plastics degradation (Jadaun) (Guo).
									<br>
									Under mesophilic conditions, IsPETase degrades polyethylene terephthalate by hydrolyzing the ester bonds to form mono-(2- hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), creating an acidic environment that aids the trivial production of bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and terephthalic acid (TPA). The oligomers MHET and BHET could be later hydrolyzed into terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) by a mutated MHETase as the team’s future goal(Anuar). Finally, the induction of TPA transporter allows bacteria to assimilate TPA, degrading TPA into smaller and usable compounds that promote bacteria’s growth and propagation (Guo).

									<p class = "bigger-text">
										Internal Factors:
										<br>
									</p>
						
									<p class = "bigger-text">
										Plastic biodegradability is influenced by various internal factors, which can be determined by examining certain physical and chemical properties. These include the availability of functional groups that increase hydrophobicity, and the complexity of the polymer structure, whether it is linear or branched. The presence of easily breakable bonds, such as amide and ester bonds, and the type of coupling in the chain (with esters being more easily breakable than ethers, amides, or urethanes) also play a role. Additionally, the composition of the polymer at the molecular level, its form and physical appearance (e.g., pellets, films, or powder), and its density and molecular weight are important factors. The morphology, including the proportion of the amorphous and crystalline regions, as well as the tendency for soft polymers to degrade faster than hard polymers, further contribute to the biodegradability of plastics (Yutaka).

								<p class = "bigger-text">
									External Factors:
									<br>
								</p>
									
									<p class = "bigger-text">
										Besides internal factors, external factors such as sunlight, heat, oxidation, or friction can break down plastic, but the process requires a long period while the fragments become hazardous microplastics. At a high enough temperature, plastics change from solid to liquid. The plastics can degrade through two different reactions: random chain scission and unzipping depolymerization. The former means the long chains of the polymer randomly break into smaller pieces; the latter is where the polymer chains start to "unzip" and revert back to their original monomer units. Going through these reactions allows plastics to break down (Yutaka).
									</p>

								<u>Global Status Quo</u>
							</p>
									<p class = 'bigger-text'>
										The global production of plastic has increased from 2 million metric tons in 1950 to 380 million metric tons in 2015, according to the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). Plastic gained popularity and widespread use primarily due to its lightweight, firmness, affordability, versatility, hygiene, low price, good insulator and ease of manufacturing. As a material, plastic is the cheapest out of all common packaging materials, offering significant advantages over traditional alternatives such as steel, paper, glass, and wood. The post-World War II era and the 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in plastic production as consumers sought out these benefits, leading to its adoption across various industries including medicine, furniture, transportation, packaging, and construction (Science History Institute).
										<br>
										Plastics invented out of necessity and innovation, have revolutionized the modern world since their inception just over a century ago. Ever since the end of WWII, their production rapidly escalated, leading to the proliferation of thousands of plastic products that have become indispensable in contemporary life. In 1950, global production stood at a mere two million tonnes. Today, that figure increases to over 450 million tonnes annually (National Geographic). Despite their utility, plastics pose a grave environmental threat, particularly in their disposal and management. On a global scale, plastic pollution often begins on land, with the majority of plastic waste ending up in the oceans. According to National Geographic, major rivers serve as conduits for this flow of waste, accumulating more plastics or microplastics as they traverse downstream (National Geographic). Once in the oceans, plastic waste can easily be transported across the globe. Plastic pollution is not confined to a specific region; it is a ubiquitous global challenge. A significant concern is the dissemination of small plastic debris in the worldwide ocean, particularly microplastic that have dimensions ranging from few μm to 500 μm. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report, an estimated 81.98 ti 357.56 tonnes of plastic waste annually leak into aquatic ecosystems, contaminating lakes, rivers, and seas, thereby jeopardizing aquatic life and ecosystems worldwide. Each year, millions of animals, spanning from birds to fish to various marine organisms, nearly 700 species, have been impacted by plastics to some degree. Seabirds, in particular, are profoundly impacted as they tend to feed on the water’s surface where large plastics debris collected (Ocean Blue Project). Similarly, small floating microplastic will be consumed by planktonic communities, which are later egested through their fecal particles and precipitated as floor sediments as a food source for marine organisms, leading to toxic and devastated health concerns through biological magnification (Guo). However, this rapid expansion in plastic production has not been matched by effective waste management strategies.

													In 2020, the production value of plastic film in Taiwan reached $2.8 billion (Formosa Plastics Group at TITAS).
												</li>
												<li>
													Taiwan's plastic and rubber product exports were valued at $1.4 billion in 2014, up 10% from 2013. The main export markets are China, Southeast Asia, Japan, USA, Turkey, Mexico, Eastern Europe, Russia and the Middle East (Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry).
												</li>
												<li>
													The total annual production value of the global plastic and rubber machinery industry in 2012 was estimated at €29.2 billion. Taiwan ranked among the top 5 producers, along with Germany, China, Italy, and Japan (Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry).
												</li>
												<li>
													Taiwan’s transition to a circular economy is reshaping Taiwan's approach to plastics, where the government has introduced strategies to enhance recycling and reduce waste, resulting in a domestic recycling rate of 51% as of 2019. This transition not only addresses environmental concerns but also creates economic opportunities in the recycling and green manufacturing sectors (National Library of Medicine)
												</li>
												<li>
													Specifically discussing Taiwan's national efforts in the plastics revolution, in July 1991, the Taiwanese government’s policy regulation restricted the use of plastic bags for shopping and has been implemented in the following 14 control subjects: (1) Public sector, (2) Private schools, (3) Department stores and shopping malls, (4) Mass retailers Store industry, (5) Supermarket industry, (6) Chain convenience store industry, (7) Chain fast food restaurant public sector, etc. 7 categories On August 15, 2020, this department revised the announcement "Restricted objects and actual use of plastic bags for shopping". "Implementation method and implementation date", (8) drug stores, beauty stores, and pharmacies, (9) medical equipment stores, (10) Retail of home appliances, photography, information, and communication equipment, (11) Retail of books and stationery, (12) Laundry Clothing store industry, (13) beverage store industry, (14) pastry bakery industry (Environmental Information Center). However, 91.44% of the plastic bags are used in places such as traditional markets, snack stalls, and dine-in restaurants with storefronts, which are not included in the government-restricted subjects (Environmental Information Center). Most usage in these policy-excluded groups highlights the ineffectiveness and lack of implementing the plastics-related regulation policy. According to the national report, the top reasons behind the enormous amount of plastics used in these places are due to Taiwanese citizens not used to carrying eco-friendly bags, as well as the convenience, and alternative use of garbage bags in the future (Taiwan News).
												</li>
												<li>
													Besides governmental actions, several NGOs and environmental activists have been working on combating plastics pollution in recent ten years. For example, one of the most prominent environmental NGO called Greenpeace, originally founded in Canada but later established in Taiwan in 2010, is engaged in combating plastic pollution through various initiatives and campaigns (Greenpeace). Greenpeace's efforts have led to increased awareness and policy changes, such as prohibiting disposable tableware at government events, but more action is needed to address the growing challenge of plastic pollution in Taiwan, where 750,000 metric tons of waste were temporarily stored in 2022 due to inadequate processing capacity. Moreover, their surveys reveal that single-use plastics and discarded fishing gear are the most common waste items, with plastic waste in household trash rising from 17% to 28% between 2018-2022 (Greenpeace).

								<u>Impact on Human</u>
							</p>
									<p class = "bigger-text">
										The pervasive use of plastic has led to a series of detrimental effects on both ecosystems and human health. As plastic waste accumulates, it traps and injures wildlife, including life on land and life below water, disrupting their habitats and causing a decrease in species populations. The decrease in species population ultimately impacts the balance of the food chain, reducing biodiversity and habitat quality. Microplastics, which refers to small pieces of plastic, less than 5 mm (0.2 inch) in length, that occur in the environment as a consequence of plastic pollution (Britannica). In particular, microplastics inflict significant damage at the cellular level, resulting in the demise of numerous marine and terrestrial species. Furthermore, the repercussions extend to human health, as exposure to plastic is linked to hormone imbalances leading to endocrine disruption, lung disease, insulin resistance, decreased reproductive health, and an increased risk of cancer (AAMC). According to a study by Ocean Conservancy in 2023, it is estimated that the average adult consumes approximately 121,000 microplastic particles per year (Environmental Science and Technology). Even seemingly innocuous aspects, such as plastic food storage packages, may harbor toxic chemicals that find their way into the human body. Microplastics and nanoplastics – are even smaller than microplastics, typically considered to be less than one µm in size – can enter the human bloodstream and organs through inhalation, oral intake, skin contact, and direct consumptions such as bioaccumulative seafood and tap water. According to Harvard Health, heating plastics in the microwave, or high-temperature environments, may cause chemicals or toxins to leach into your foods, leading to 400,000 to one million people die annually (Harvard Public Health Review ). In addition, air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer and breast cancer as well as respiratory and heart diseases. In the next three years, the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality increased by 4.53 times (Mainichi).
									</p>
												
							<p class="bigger-text">
								<u>Impact on Environment</u>
							</p>
									<p class = "bigger-text">
										Moreover, the manufacturing process itself releases harmful chemicals, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) releasing chemicals (nickel, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, benzene), posing an even more serious threat to environmental and human well-being. The reason why PET plastics release the most chemicals out of all commonly used plastics is because antimony, specifically antimony trioxide, is used as the dominant catalyst to hasten the process of producing PET plastic (Swapna). The high toxicity of antimony is known to affect the growth, reproduction, and overall health of various organisms, such as soil-dwelling organisms like earthworms. Under extreme conditions like high heat, UV exposure, and long storage time, the leaching of these chemicals increases. Moreover, these toxins accumulate in organisms, known as biomagnification, impacting the food chain as there is higher concentration of toxin in higher trophic levels. Microbial communities degrade long-chain plastic polymers into organic matter, transforming it into the food of higher-level marine plankton, thus leading to catastrophic impacts on the whole marine food web. As a result, this bioaccumulation can pose a risk to organisms at the top of the food chain, including humans. Nevertheless, some antimony remains in the product after production, with the potential to enter into food, drinks, and the environment. In addition, microplastics can significantly alter carbon assimilation and microbial diversity. These microorganisms first attach to the plastic, form a biofilm, and break it down into smaller molecules. This process also impacts other cycles like nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. In coastal areas, microplastics alter microbial communities and nitrogen processes. Plastics in estuaries increase activities that produce N2O, a greenhouse gas, more than the surrounding water (Guo). With all the inevitable impact on human health and the ecosystem, the urgent need for sustainable practices for plastic has never been more apparent in the face of these far-reaching consequences.

								Most Common Techniques... and Their Drawbacks:
								<br>
							</p>
											<p class = "bigger-text">
												To achieve sustainability and perseverance, PET recycling is a substantial process to reduce and mitigate the detrimental effects of plastic waste. Specifically, PET recycling includes two commonly used techniques: mechanical recycling and chemical recycling (BioMed Central). 
											</p>
											<center><img src = "figure 6" alt= "figure 6" width = "" height = ""></center>

												<p class = postcard-index>
													Figure 6: Current techniques for PET plastic recycling and their drawbacks
												</p>
											</center>
											<p class = "bigger-text">
												The first method, mechanical recycling, is the most common one for PET recycling due to cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency (Joseph). Mechanical recycling involves processes such as shredding PET plastic into smaller pieces, further going into cleaning, melting, and molding. The series of steps separates the plastic structure from contaminants and melts them to create molten PET resin, molding the PET resin into new products, such as bottles, fibers, or films. However, there are two major drawbacks of mechanical recycling: reduced quality and environmental impact. First, mechanical recycling involves repeated processing of plastics, which can lead to the degradation of the material. The quality of the recycled plastic may be lower compared to the original, and this lower quality plastic may eventually be discarded in landfills, highlighting the inefficacy of this method. Second, the process of melting down and recycling plastic can produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which harm plants and animal lives near the industrial site. Additionally, the heat required to melt plastic generates carbon emissions, contributing to global warming (The Welding Institute). 
												<br>
												The second method, chemical recycling involves chemical reactions such as glycolysis and methanolysis to produce high-quality PET monomers, which can be used to produce new PET products (European Chemical Industry Council). PET chemical recycling entails breaking down the extended chains of PET molecules into individual monomers, which are then utilized in the creation of new PET or other items. The procedure encompasses various stages, including depolymerization, purification, re-polymerization, and forming. Chemical recycling of PET presents numerous advantages compared to mechanical recycling, including enhanced resilience and versatility in the resulting product (Bioplastics News). Moreover, it can generate high-quality recycled PET with properties closely resembling virgin PET, rendering it suitable for demanding applications such as food packaging and automotive components. Nevertheless, the significant obstacles of chemical recycling lie in scalability and commercial viability, underscoring its inability to replace the mechanical recycling method (Renewable Carbon). First, chemical recycling is still in the early stages of development, and this technical challenge limits the facilities to conduct small-scale tests and practices. Furthermore, even though chemical recycling has the potential to produce high-quality recycled plastics that are indistinguishable from new plastic, the quality varies depending on the specific process used, demonstrating the challenge of producing consistent high-quality recycled plastic.

								<i>Interest & Motivation</i>
							</h4>
								<p class = "bigger-text">
									The team’s inspiration came from a Biology course, where we learned about the devastating consequences of endocrine disruption – a prevalent issue leading to cancer and chronic diseases. The inspiration hit close to our homeland. In Taiwan, plastic bags are ubiquitous, even enclosing steaming hot noodle soups from street vendors. These seemingly innocuous bags leach harmful chemicals, posing a threat to human health by misregulating the human body’s hormonal balance.

								<i>Past IGEM Teams Inspiration</i>
							</h4>
									<p class = "bigger-text">
										Our team also checked previous iGEM teams' projects related to PET plastic degradation, and the 2018 Yale University iGEM team. “Making bacteria eat plastic" got the team’s attention (Yale iGEM). The Yale iGEM team also used the PETase gene for their project. Our team wanted to upgrade the PET plastic degradation project to make an enhanced PETase enzyme with 3 amino acid mutations utilizing a strain of Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, IsPETaseS121E/D186H/R280A. The team also upgraded the original Yale project using bacteria for induction only. Our team expressed the cloned IsPETase, along with several mutations on the IsPETase gene respectively, downstream of the pGal1,10 promoter for the yeast strain, saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can induce 20-30-fold induction in the presence of galactose.

								In recent decades,  biological recycling has employed enzymes or microorganisms to decompose PET plastic waste into simpler compounds to mitigate environmental pollution. Bio Recycling, or enzymatic recycling, represents an innovative approach utilizing enzymes to break down PET products into their monomers, and the process for PET plastic degradation via this method involves distinct steps: collection and sorting of PET waste, size reduction, enzymatic depolymerization, purification, and polymerization (U.S. Government Accountability Office). This method currently stands as the most environmentally friendly approach, mitigating the impact of plastic waste without relying on fossil fuels, even for processing low-quality PET waste. Additionally, it yields high-quality monomers suitable for producing new PET with properties akin to virgin PET.
								<br>
								Furthermore, bio-recycling has the potential to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, reduce energy consumption, and enhance the overall efficiency of PET plastic degradation product recycling. Despite these promising aspects, recycling is in its early stages and requires further research and optimization for commercial viability, posing challenges such as time-consuming, scalability, and environmental impacts. Specifically addressing the environmental issues, the major limitation of the bio-recycling technique is that biodegradable plastics disposed of in landfills produce CO2 and methane, which negatively affect the climate (U.S. Government Accountability Office, National Library of Medicine). Thus, polymers must be recycled to address this problem (Feig et al., 2018; La Mantia et al., 2020; Samir et al., 2022). However, to recycle polymers, the mechanical recycling of biodegradable plastics possesses one major limitation: Developing a specific recycling system for biodegradable plastics is unrealistic and ineffective as they only account for 1% of the total amount of plastic consumed. Moreover, challenges like limited applicability and implementation costs are all the factors to be considered when introducing this relatively new recycling technique (U.S. Government Accountability Office).
								<br>
								All in all, these methods can reduce the amount of PET products that end up in landfills or oceans, and contribute to developing a circular economy. However, each method has limitations, such as the quality and quantity of collected PET products, contamination, and material quality. Thus, our team’s solution aims to improve efficiency, which solves the limitations of current methods.

									Besides in vivo experiments, our team can do in vitro protein purification to extract the IsPETase enzyme and several amino acid mutants of the IsPETase enzymes, respectively. The downstream of this T7 promoter is engineered to contain a 6-histidine tag (6-his tag), Once the cloned IsPETase gene to the downstream of the 6-his tag, along with the several amino acid mutants of the IsPETase enzymes, respectively, the team will transform them into BL21DE3 bacteria to express those enzymes in the presence of ITPG. Those wild-type and different mutants of the IsPETase enzymes containing the 6-his tag are in the protein extract after the chemical process to break BL21DE3 bacterial cells and run the protein extract through the Ni+-resin column, which can bind to the 6-his tag on the wild-types PETase and the several amino acid mutants of the IsPETase enzymes respectively, and then several chemical buffers to wash the column containing the samples to wash away unbound/unwanted proteins respectively, until the elution buffer is used to purify out the enzymes our team desires to the tubes, respectively.
